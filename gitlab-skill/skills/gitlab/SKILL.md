# GitLab Documentation Skill

Use this skill when working with GitLab APIs, webhooks, CI/CD pipelines, or any GitLab-related tasks.

## Available Documentation

This skill provides comprehensive documentation for:

1. **GitLab API** - Complete REST API reference for interacting with GitLab programmatically
2. **Webhooks** - GitLab webhook events, payloads, and configuration
3. **CI/CD** - GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration, jobs, and features
4. **Runners** - GitLab Runner installation, configuration, and management
5. **Authentication** - OAuth, personal access tokens, and authentication methods
6. **Projects** - Project management, repository operations, and settings
7. **Merge Requests** - MR API, workflows, and automation
8. **Issues** - Issue tracking, boards, and management

## How to Use This Skill

When working with GitLab:

1. Reference the appropriate documentation in the `references/` directory for detailed information
2. For API operations, consult `references/api.md` for endpoints, parameters, and response formats
3. For webhook integrations, use `references/webhooks.md` for event types and payload structures
4. For CI/CD pipelines, refer to `references/ci-cd.md` for .gitlab-ci.yml syntax and features
5. For runner setup, check `references/runners.md` for installation and configuration

## Best Practices

- Always check API version compatibility when making GitLab API calls
- Use appropriate authentication methods (personal access tokens, OAuth) based on the use case
- Follow GitLab's rate limiting guidelines to avoid throttling
- Validate webhook signatures for security
- Use pipeline best practices for efficient CI/CD workflows
